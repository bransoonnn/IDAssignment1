My Personal Portfolio


The website serves the purpose of providing recruiters considering to hire the me a chance to get to know me more. it also serves the purpose of presenting myself in the best light and get noticed by the recuriters. The webiste consists of 5 pages. 
The Landing Page, the about page which acts similar to a portfolio with all the basic information, skills and experiences I have. next, the projects page, it consists of the work i have done previously as well as the link for the reader to view my past works. Next is the contact page, it consists of the basic contact infromation as well as a email form for convinence to the user. Lastly, the certificates page whihc showcases the certificates i have collected over the years from leadership, to competitions.


Design Process
For the Design Process, I built this website with the goal of letting the viewers get to know me better and be able to view my previous works and get an idea of my abilites. It is easy to naviagate around with the nav bar on the top of every page, and almost all the pages need not require scrolling before being able to view the entire page, hence allowing simplicity to the user.
With convience, i also added many hyperlinks such as the ones on my past project for the users to be able to take a closer look at the final work with a press of a button. The popup expansion on the certificate page also act like a manifying glass for the viewers benefit of viewing it clearly. The email form on the contact page also let viewers need not open a whole new app and manually key in the information just to send an email but rather instantly on the website.
Hence the design process goal was to be able to put myself in the best light, simple and convenient for the viewers.

This Website uses HTML for the base of the website. CSS for the design and Javascript for some animation.

A bug I have is that when the email form is clicked, it automatically bring the user to a " page not found " in the future i hope to gain the ability to be able to have the mail app popup and automatically fill in the email details for the viewers conveninence
